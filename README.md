# House Price Prediction with Regression Model

## Why
We want to model single-family home sale price using these predictor variables:
- __Size__ floor size (thousands of square feet)
- __Lot__ lot size category (from 1 to 11 explained below)
- __Bath__ number of bathrooms (with half-bathrooms counting as 0.1 explained further in the report)
- __Bed__ number of bedrooms (between 2 and 6)
- __Year__ year the house was built.
- __Garage__ garage size (0, 1, 2, or 3 cars)
- __High__ indicator for The High School (reference: The High School)
- __Alexandra__ indicator for Alexandra College (reference: Alexandra College)
- __Stratford__ indicator for Stratford College (reference: Stratford College)
- __St.Mary's__ indicator for St.Mary's College (reference: St.Mary's College)
- __St Louis__ indicator for St Louis High School (reference: St Louis High School)
